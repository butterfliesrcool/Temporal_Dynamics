```

NOTES: 
The negative binomial distribution is similar to the Poisson except it has an additional parameter called a scale parameter. The scale parameter (𝜹) allows the variance to be larger (or smaller) than the mean and may reduce or remedy the over-dispersion problem. Some argue that the negative binomial should always be used for agricultural data while others disagree. 

###In statistics, a zero-inflated model is a statistical model based on a zero-inflated probability distribution, i.e. a distribution that allows for frequent zero-valued observations.

Zero-inflated negative binomial regression is for modeling count variables with excessive zeros and it is usually for over-dispersed count outcome variables. Furthermore, theory suggests that the excess zeros are generated by a separate process from the count values and that the excess zeros can be modeled independently.

### try glmer.nb() function: https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/lme4/html/glmer.nb.html
#### From Documentation: subset: an optional expression indicating the subset of the rows of data that should be used in the fit. This can be a logical vector, or a numeric vector indicating which observation numbers are to be included, or a character vector of the row names to be included. All observations are included by default.

##Data needs to be broken down by day for the learning check analysis but it doesn't for everything else 

##writing out data for each individual day can artificially cause increased zero inflation 

## Not accounting for overdispersion can lead to artificially small p values

# SUMMARY: the poisson model has a lower AIC score than the binomial model. With the poisson model, I get a significant deviation in the KS test, which suggests that data are not uniform with respect to the specified distribution. To correct for this, I fitted another model with a negative binomial distribution, this model had a slightly larger AIC score, but corrected for the significant deviation in the KS test. Given that, which model should I use????

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), if we’re dealing with various other variable types and error structure (e.g., binary, proportion, or count data).

GLMM for all data - but we don't want to compare all the data... do we? 

Too much information here... 
```{r}
m <- glmer(attacks ~ species + trial + time.delay + day + (1|site), data = data, family = binomial)
summary(m, corr = FALSE)
###"day" is the only strong predictor of patterns in the data
###ALSO no significant difference in attack rates between the time delayed trials: four, two, one
#######How can I show this more explicitly? do I need to? 
```

```{r}
m <- glmer(attacks ~ trial*species*day + (1|site), data = data, family = binomial)
```


We start by just comparing the three trials with temporal delays in exposure to models and mimics. We can't directly compare these trials to the simultaneous trial because we do not have comparable sample sizes 
```{r}
temp.delay <- subset(data, trial %in% c("model", "mimic"), drop = FALSE)
class(temp.delay$day) #integer... boo...
temp.delay$day <- as.factor(temp.delay$day)
class(temp.delay$day)

m <- glmer(attacks ~ trial*species + (1|site), data =  temp.delay, family = binomial)
# Post-hoc analysis
emmeans(m, pairwise ~ trial * species) ###only look at the comparisons that are biologically meaningful??
```

Summary of Findings: 
- no significant differences between time delayed trials in any of the models 
- day is the main predictor of patterns in the data, with no significant diferences between species when looking at all experimental days. the effects of day go away when looking at days 2-4, and significant patterns between species emerge
